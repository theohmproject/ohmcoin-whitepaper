Techonology: Reinventing the Wheel

Historically, development of technologies have been built upon previous discoveries. In the analog world you can see many examples of this, powered flight is one of these examples and took over 2400 years of discoveries to come to fruition and began with the chinese "bamboo-copter". The automobile is another one of these examples and began it's roots with the potters wheel over 6500 years ago. Both of these examples usually have one thing in common, they both use the wheel to accomblish different tasks. The plane usually uses the wheel for take offs and landings, the automobile uses it to travel over the land and the potters wheel has been used to produce beautiful round shaped pottery. The wheel has not changed much in fuction but is the foundation for many different uses.

Simularly, the technology behind Ohmcoin has been built upon previous open source technologies such as Bitcoin, DASH and PIVX. This process is known as forking. By forking previous technologies ohmcoin can build upon the successes of these techologies without having to "reinvent the wheel".


Future Proofing:
Although a continuous process, in the current context of this paper, the following is to provide a clear upgrade path for Ohmcoin using other already existing technologies that are a necessity for the continued success of Ohmcoin and the AoK Platform for the foreseeable Future.
