History may not repeat, but it certainly rhymes.

When in the Course of human events it becomes apparent that the bands of control and power stem from a universally common source, the necessity of separation from these powers becomes a matter of survival.

For as long as the printing press has existed, the whole of civilization has quietly fallen under the influence of sovereign entities with the ability to control the value of expended work through the manipulation and control of currency. The 'sweat off the brow' ceased to be represented by any discernible value, but rather through an unseen, uncontrollable force of entities outside control of the masses exchanging their representative currencies.

The expenditure of energy by man, machine, and Nature is the sole source of Value. These sources and their result have been devalued through the intentional inflation of printed currencies. Money and currency as understood by the global population are no longer an expression of the collective output of exertion, but rather an arbitrary calculation of unaccountable individuals and organizations that hold them in their influence. Humanity has fallen under the domination of control through Fiat, but this domination has only increased the pressure of humanity seeking a viable escape.

When entities acquire the power to artificially create Value with the stroke of a pen, bribery and collusion become a trivial matter for those with that power. Those with access to this power naturally develop a bubble of judicial protection, accelerating disparity of wealth. As a result, the Value of Work has been wholly degraded by arbitrary calculations of political expediency. The integrity of Value within all societies has been literally and figuratively forced to the brink of irreconcilability.

This viable escape has come in the form of provable and irrefutable math through the expenditure of energy -- Bitcoin and its derivative cryptoassets.

Prior to the proliferation of cryptoassets, the option of the State abdicating control over the supply of currency was never a viable possibility due to threat of forgery, and the costs to secure the integrity of the currencies. The State, and only the State, could secure the integrity of a printed currency through the threat and employment of Force. The maintenance of this integrity is a noble cause and necessary to the stability of a state, because it ensured the exchange of value could be trusted. However, the maintenance of that integrity can, has, and is fundamentally manipulated.

Whilst the State still maintains a justifiable monopoly on the lawful application of violent force, its monopoly on the control of currency has been demonstrably displaced by the implementation of Bitcoin and its cryptoasset derivatives.

Where value was once proven by the strength of the State "at the end of a barrel", humans have developed, demonstrated, and proliferated a technology capable of proving value through the expenditure of electricity via the irrevocable proof of math. Such a concept has never been accomplished prior to the initiation of the Bitcoin blockchain.

As use of cryptocurrencies has spread and adoption rates have grown throughout the world over the past decade, the paradigm of 'value' has shifted in the minds of those who truly grasp the capabilities of this new technology of 'value transfer'. Whereas the Internet changed how humans viewed the transfer of information, cryptoassets are doing the same with the transfer of value.

We are not declaring Independence from State Controlled Currency -- We are declaring Controlled Currencies through fiat have been rendered Obsolete.

Our reasons for declaring obsolescence are plentiful. Many deaths and crimes of the previous Century can be traced to unaccountable entities with control of currencies who have gained control of the many levers of power in order to direct the course of Humanity.

Those who create our currencies have conspired to assume Total Control of the global money supplies, while obfuscating through suppression of media and education the fact that they are capable of conspiracy.

They embody the systemic risk with the hypocrisy of providing loans to public banks that must provide transparent audits, while avoiding any such audits themselves.

Their behavior has consistently tipped the scales of potentially Open Markets in favor of providing newly printed currencies to those they trust, as opposed to those the Free Markets trust.

They have ingratiated themselves through the selective support of lawmakers and regulators whom enact policies that ensure their actions are exposed to minimal risk and maximal gains by diverting consequences on the populations which use their currencies.

They have degraded the public trust in elected representatives and the equal application of justice by collectively avoiding any accountability for creating systemic risks.

They have become Cause and Solution to financial crises, to which there is no means of recourse for the rest of Humanity, which bears this burden as a result of Their behaviors.

This Declaration of Currency Independence is a direct response to the continued manipulation and destruction that stems from the deliberate degradation of Value across the whole of humanity.

We, the undersigned, will dedicate our lives building networks and systems that restore the Integrity of Value and directly challenge the authority of those who seek to destroy Value.

Notes for Updates To Whitepaper:
The above statement should be addressed by the ohmcoin team and may not even exist in the final beta release of the white paper.
