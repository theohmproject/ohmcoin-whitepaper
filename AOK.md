AOK(Acts of Kindness) Platform: A decentralized crowdfunding donation platform that removes social, religious and political bias inherent in centralized systems via a voting structure through an established network of karmnodes(masternodes).

Although simular to governance and proposal voting systems, the aok platform has some distinct differences. Most notably, funding is not provided by an increased super block reward, thus protecting against brief moments of large inflation. Rather, when a campaign(proposal), by vote, is approved as valid by a majority of karmanode holders, other addresses(people) will be able to donate to a specified address.

Proccess:
As with any proposal, proposals will have their birth place on the ohmcoin.org forums section where someone who is looking to begin a crowdfunding campaign can engage the community. This engagement will allow the community to assist campaigns to be as successful as possible. This can include but is not limited to, verification of legitimacy of campaign proposal, receive help in writing up a proposal, gaining pointers on where a campaign proposal needs improvements or just to see if a proposal would get any backing.

Once a campaign has gained community support, the campaign submitter sends a small predetermined fee (helps prevent spam) to a specified burn address which activates the voting process for the type of campaign they would like voted on. Once the voting process concludes and if the campaign submitted is accepted by majority vote, the campaign goes into the funding phase.

During the funding phase, people will be able to donate to a campaign, those that are sending donations from a staking and or karmanode address will receive a small increase in reward for a certain period of blocks at the completion of the campaign(Incentivized Acts of Kindness). Those that donate to a passthrough campaign will immediately receive increased rewards. In the event that a campaign does not achieve it's goals or is terminated mid-flight all funds shall be returned to the donation addresses.

In the event the vetting of a campaign was not discovered to be illegitimate during the forum process a mid-flight cancelation can initiated. Mid-flight cancellation of a campaign can only occur from a majority vote. Causes for consideration of cancellation of a campaign mid-flight include, discovery of funds are being used for something other than what the campaign intended, money laundering, terrorism, illicit drug activity or any other illicit activity.
