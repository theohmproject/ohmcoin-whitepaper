AOK(Acts of Kindness) Platform: A decentralized donation platform that removes social and political bias that are inheriant in centralized systems via voting through and established network of karmnodes. 

Although simular to the governance and proposal voting system, the aok platform has some distinct differences. Most notably, funding is not provided by an increased super block reward, thus protecting against brief moments of large inflation. Rather, when a campaign(proposal), by vote is approved as valid by a majority of karmanode holders. Other addresses will be able to donate to a specified address.
