AOK(Acts of Kindness) Platform: A decentralized donation platform that removes social religious and political bias inherent in centralized systems via a voting structure through an established network of karmnodes(masternodes).

Although simular to the governance and proposal voting system, the aok platform has some distinct differences. Most notably, funding is not provided by an increased super block reward, thus protecting against brief moments of large inflation. Rather, when a campaign(proposal), by vote is approved as valid by a majority of karmanode holders. Other addresses will be able to donate to a specified address.

Proccess:
As with any proposal, proposals will have their birth place on the ohmcoin.org forums section where someone who is looking to begin a crowdfunding campaign can engage the community. This engagement will allow the community to assist campaigns to be as successful as possible. This can include but is not limited to receive help in writing up a proposal, gaining pointers on where a campaign proposal needs improvements or just to see if a proposal would get any backing.

Once a campaign has gained community support, the campaign submitter sends funds(helps prevent spam) to a specified burn address which activates the voting process. Once the voting process concludes and if the campaign submitted is accepted by vote, the campaign goes into the funding phase.
